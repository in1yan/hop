### Build from Source

#### Prerequisites
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.23 or later)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or later)
- [Wails CLI](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation)

#### Build Steps
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/in1yan/hop.git
cd hop

# Install Wails (if not already installed)
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest

# Build the application
wails build
```

The built executable will be available in the `build/bin/` directory.

## Development

### Live Development
```bash
# Start the development server with hot reload
wails dev
```

This will start a Vite development server for fast frontend development and a development version of the app.
